## Minor changes (e.g. fixing typos)
You can fix typos, spelling mistakes, or grammatical errors in the documentation directly on GitHub, provided it is done so in the source file. This means you’ll need to edit roxygen2 comments in the .R file, not the .Rd file.


## Substantial changes and proposing ideas

We acknowledge a great potential for improving the functionalities of pubCounteR. If you have an idea for our new package, for example a new added feature that might improve output or functionality, please take a look at the documentation and issue list to see if it isn't included or suggested yet.
